### Step 1: Started with (AWS Managed Polices) Began by assigning AWS managed policies to my IAM users and roles. These policies provide predefined permissions for common use cases and can serve as a baseline while you assess the specific needs of your project. 

1) Sign in to the AWS Management Console: Navigate to https://aws.amazon.com/console/ and enter your credentials, As shown below.

<img width="1435" alt="Sign in AWS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e2ff84-d21b-4309-a5a8-29f5eeacf12a" />





2) Accessed the IAM Dashboard: Once logged in, go to the Services menu at the top of the page and select IAM under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section. This will direct you to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.

3) Navigate to the Policies Section: In the left-hand navigation pane of the IAM dashboard, click on Policies. This section displays a comprehensive list of IAM policies available in your account.
 
<img width="1440" alt="policies filter " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b03359d3-6ecb-455a-974f-23aca9f32b19" />

4) Filter for AWS Managed Policies: At the top of the Policies page, you'll find a filter labeled Filter policies. Click on this dropdown menu and select AWS managed. This action will filter the list to show only the policies that are created and maintained by AWS.‚Äã
AWS Documentation

<img width="1440" alt="aws managed " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc64554-11d1-4095-8565-3d55121c6da8" />

5) View and Manage Policies: Browse through the filtered list to view the AWS managed policies. You can click on any policy to see its details, including the permissions it grants and the services it affects. While you cannot modify AWS managed policies directly, you can attach them to users, groups, or roles as needed.

<img width="1439" alt="choose filter " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae58fff0-8a19-47ea-af58-44793416b534" />

### 2. Building My First IAM Policy 

 Step 1) AWS Console > IAM > Policies > Create policy as shown below. 
<img width="1440" alt="creating policies" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0107b04e-8ca2-4b1f-9542-8ac4a049c7b2" />

Step 2) In this step you have the choose to use Visual or JSON, for this project I used visual but you can always use JSON meaning youll have to generate your own code for permissions. After selecting visual  then select Choose a services > Ec2 as shown below: 
<img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-11 at 12 38 47‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5812580-4d1d-4d31-88f3-bb781cc165ed" /> 

Step 3) Add EC2 Actions, Expand "List" ‚Üí Check 'DescribeInstances, 'DescribeInstanceStatus then Expand "Write" ‚Üí Check: 'StartInstances, 'StopInstances, `RebootInstances, `TerminateInstances . This gives full basic control over EC2 instances as shown below: 

Access Levels:

###3. Set/Assign I AM User (Never use Root!)(Goal: Create a user with limited permissions so you don‚Äôt use the root account for daily tasks.)

Step 1) Go to the IAM Dashboard: AWS Console > Search for IAM > Click Users > Create user
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 10 58 22‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49d2c0da-4c0f-4320-8200-4690ece033f5" />

Step 2) Username: cloud-adminLiinkzz (name of your choice)
